# kubernetes and os setup examples

This documents contains several examples to show working setups for a development environment

## tested on ubuntu 18.04.4 with minikube 1.9.2 and zfs 0.7 and 0.8

### Prerequisites
* You have a zfs pool created on localhost, with pool name `zfspv-pool`; that is you have installed
zfs-dkms (or zfs-fuse), zfs-zed and zfsutils-linux .deb packages. And then created the pool with `zpool create` command
* You have followed the prerequisites stated in [Development Workflow](developer-setup.md)

```
wget https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/download/v1.9.2/minikube_1.9.2-0_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i minikube_1.9.2-0_amd64.deb
sudo minikube start --driver=none
sudo chown -R $USER $HOME/.kube $HOME/.minikube

kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openebs/zfs-localpv/master/deploy/zfs-operator.yaml
kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l role=openebs-zfs

export OPENEBS_NAMESPACE=openebs
export KUBECONFIG=$HOME/.kube/config

cd ~/path/to/directory/openebs/zfs-localpv/tests

ginkgo -v
```

All the tests should pass now.
