## About this experiment

This experiment creates the clone directly from the volume as datasource and use that cloned volume for some application. This experiment verifies that clone volume should have the same data for which snaphsot was taken and this data should be easily accessible from some new application when this clone volume is mounted on it.

## Supported platforms:
K8s : 1.18+

OS : Ubuntu, CentOS

ZFS : 0.7, 0.8

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s cluster should be in healthy state including all desired nodes in ready state.
- zfs-controller and node-agent daemonset pods should be in running state.
- Application should be deployed successfully consuming zfs-localpv storage.
- size for the clone-pvc should be equal to the original pvc.

## Steps performed

This experiment consist of provisioning and deprovisioning of zfspv-clone but performs one task at a time based on ACTION env value < provision or deprovision >.

Provision:

- Create the clone by applying the pvc yaml with parent pvc name in the datasource.
- Verify that clone-pvc gets bound.
- Deploy new application and verifies that clone volume gets successully mounted on application.
- Verify the data consistency that it should contain the same data as of volume snapshot.

Deprovision:

- Delete the application which is using the cloned volume.
- Verify that clone pvc is deleted successfully.
- Verify that zvolume is deleted successfully.

## How to run

- This experiment accepts the parameters in form of kubernetes job environmental variables.
- For running this experiment of zfs-localpv clone directly form pvc, first clone openens/zfs-localpv[https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv] repo and then apply rbac and crds for e2e-framework.
```
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/crds.yaml
```
then update the needed test specific values in run_e2e_test.yml file and create the kubernetes job.
```
kubectl create -f run_e2e_test.yml
```
All the env variables description is provided with the comments in the same file.

After creating kubernetes job, when the jobâ€™s pod is instantiated, we can see the logs of that pod which is executing the test-case.

```
kubectl get pods -n e2e
kubectl logs -f <zfspv-clone-from-pvc-xxxxx-xxxxx> -n e2e
```
To get the test-case result, get the corresponding e2e custom-resource `e2eresult` (short name: e2er ) and check its phase (Running or Completed) and result (Pass or Fail).

```
kubectl get e2er
kubectl get e2er zfspv-clone-from-pvc -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.phase
kubectl get e2er zfspv-clone-from-pvc -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.result
```
