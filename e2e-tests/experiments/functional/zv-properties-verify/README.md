## About this experiment

This experiment verifies that zvolume properties are same as set via the stoarge-class.

## Supported platforms:

K8s : 1.18+

OS : Ubuntu, CentOS

ZFS : 0.7, 0.8

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s cluster should be in healthy state including all desired nodes in ready state.
- zfs-controller and node-agent daemonset pods should be in running state.

## Steps performed

- Get the zvolume name and the storage class name by which volume was provisioned.
- After that following properties are verified to be same from zvol properties as well as from storage class.
  1. File-system type
  2. Compression
  3. Dedup
  4. Recordsize / volblocksize

## How to run

- This experiment accepts the parameters in form of kubernetes job environmental variables.
- For running this experiment of zv properties verify, clone openens/zfs-localpv[https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv] repo and then first apply rbac and crds for e2e-framework.
```
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/crds.yaml
```
then update the needed test specific values in run_e2e_test.yml file and create the kubernetes job.
```
kubectl create -f run_e2e_test.yml
```
All the env variables description is provided with the comments in the same file.
After creating kubernetes job, when the jobâ€™s pod is instantiated, we can see the logs of that pod which is executing the test-case.

```
kubectl get pods -n e2e
kubectl logs -f <zv-properties-verify-xxxxx-xxxxx> -n e2e
```
To get the test-case result, get the corresponding e2e custom-resource `e2eresult` (short name: e2er ) and check its phase (Running or Completed) and result (Pass or Fail).

```
kubectl get e2er
kubectl get e2er zv-properties-verify -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.phase
kubectl get e2er zv-properties-verify -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.result
```
