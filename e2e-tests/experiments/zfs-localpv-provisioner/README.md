## About this experiment

This experiment deploys the zfs-localpv provisioner in kube-system namespace which includes zfs-controller statefulset (with default value of replica count 1) and csi-node agent deamonset. Apart from this, zpool creation on nodes and generic use-case storage-classes and snapshot class for dynamic provisioning of the volumes based on values provided via env's in run_e2e_test.yml file gets created in this experiment.

## Supported platforms:

K8s: 1.18+

OS: Ubuntu, CentOS

ZFS: 0.7, 0.8

## Entry-Criteria

- K8s cluster should be in healthy state including all the desired worker nodes in ready state.
- External disk should be attached to the nodes for zpool creation on top of it.
- If we dont use this experiment to deploy zfs-localpv provisioner, we can directly apply the zfs-operator file via command as mentioned below and make sure you have zpool created on desired nodes to provision volumes.
```kubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/zfs-operator.yaml```

## Exit-Criteria

- zfs-localpv components should be deployed successfully and all the pods including zfs-controller and csi node-agent daemonset are in running state.

## Steps performed

- zpool creation on nodes
  - if `ZPOOL_CREATION` env value is set to `true` zpool is created on the nodes.
  - selection of nodes on which zpool will be created, is taken via the values of     `ZPOOL_NODE_NAME` env. if it is blank then zpool will be created on all worker nodes.
  - selected nodes will be labeled (if all nodes are used then labeling will be skipped as it is unnecessary) so that a privileged daemoset pods can schedule on those nodes and can create zpool on respected nodes by executing zpool create command via daemonset pods.
  - Delete the daemonset and remove label from nodes after zpool creation.
- Download the operator file for zfs-localpv driver from `ZFS_BRANCH`.
- Update the zfs-operator namespace if it is specified other than default value `openebs` in `ZFS_OPERATOR_NAMESPACE` env.
- Update the zfs-driver image tag. (if specified other than ci tag)
- Apply the operator yaml and wait for zfs-controller and csi-node agent pods to come up in Running state.
- Create general use case storage_classes for dynamic volume provisioning.
- Create one volumesnapshot class for capturing zfs volume snapshot.

## How to run

- This experiment accepts the parameters in form of kubernetes job environmental variables.
- For running this experiment of deploying zfs-localpv provisioner, clone openebs/zfs-localpv[https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv] repo and then first apply rbac and crds for e2e-framework.
```
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/crds.yaml
```
then update the needed test specific values in run_e2e_test.yml file and create the kubernetes job.
```
kubectl create -f run_e2e_test.yml
```
All the env variables description is provided with the comments in the same file.

After creating kubernetes job, when the jobâ€™s pod is instantiated, we can see the logs of that pod which is executing the test-case.

```
kubectl get pods -n e2e
kubectl logs -f <zfs-localpv-provisioner-xxxxx-xxxxx> -n e2e
```
To get the test-case result, get the corresponding e2e custom-resource `e2eresult` (short name: e2er ) and check its phase (Running or Completed) and result (Pass or Fail).

```
kubectl get e2er
kubectl get e2er zfs-localpv-provisioner -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.phase
kubectl get e2er zfs-localpv-provisioner -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.result
```
