## About this experiment

This experiment validates the stability and fault-tolerance of application pod consuming zfs-localpv storage. In this test chaos is induced on the container of application pod using pumba chaos utils. Basically it is used as a disruptive test, to cause loss of access to storage by failing the application pod and later it tests the recovery workflow of the application pod.

## Supported platforms:

K8s : 1.18+

OS : Ubuntu, CentOS

ZFS : 0.7, 0.8

## Entry-Criteria

- One application should be deployed consuming zfs-localpv storage.
- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Application writes are successful
- zfs-controller and csi node-agent daemonset pods should be in running state.

## Exit-Criteria

- Application services are accessible & pods are healthy
- Data written prior to chaos is successfully retrieved/read
- Data consistency is maintained as per integrity check utils
- Storage target pods are healthy

## Steps performed

- Get the application pod name and check its Running status
- Dump some dummy data into the application mount point to check data consistency after chaos injection.
- Create a daemonset of pumba utils and get the name of the pod scheduled on the same node as of application pod. Utils used in this test is located at `e2e-tests/chaoslib/pumba` directory.
- Now using SIGKILL command via pumba pod disrupt the access of application container to the storage. And now in recovery process container restarts.
- Check the container restart count to validate successful chaos injection.
- Validate the data consistency by checking the md5sum of test data.
- Delete the pumba daemonset.

## How to run

- This experiment accepts the parameters in form of kubernetes job environmental variables.
- For running this experiment of application pod failure, clone openens/zfs-localpv[https://github.com/openebs/zfs-localpv] repo and then first apply rbac and crds for e2e-framework.
```
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/rbac.yaml
kubectl apply -f zfs-localpv/e2e-tests/hack/crds.yaml
```
then update the needed test specific values in run_e2e_test.yml file and create the kubernetes job.
```
kubectl create -f run_e2e_test.yml
```
All the env variables description is provided with the comments in the same file.

After creating kubernetes job, when the jobâ€™s pod is instantiated, we can see the logs of that pod which is executing the test-case.

```
kubectl get pods -n e2e
kubectl logs -f <application-pod-failure-xxxxx-xxxxx> -n e2e
```
To get the test-case result, get the corresponding e2e custom-resource `e2eresult` (short name: e2er ) and check its phase (Running or Completed) and result (Pass or Fail).

```
kubectl get e2er
kubectl get e2er application-pod-failure -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.phase
kubectl get e2er application-pod-failure -n e2e --no-headers -o custom-columns=:.spec.testStatus.result
```
