            readyToUse:
              description: readyToUse indicates if a snapshot is ready to be used
                to restore a volume. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field
                will be filled in with the "ready_to_use" value returned from CSI
                "CreateSnapshotRequest" gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this
                field will be filled with the "ready_to_use" value returned from the
                CSI "ListSnapshots" gRPC call if the driver supports it, otherwise,
                this field will be set to "True". If not specified, it means the readiness
                of a snapshot is unknown.

            restoreSize:
              description: restoreSize represents the complete size of the snapshot
                in bytes. In dynamic snapshot creation case, this field will be filled
                in with the "size_bytes" value returned from CSI "CreateSnapshotRequest"
                gRPC call. For a pre-existing snapshot, this field will be filled
                with the "size_bytes" value returned from the CSI "ListSnapshots"
                gRPC call if the driver supports it. When restoring a volume from
                this snapshot, the size of the volume MUST NOT be smaller than the
                restoreSize if it is specified, otherwise the restoration will fail.
                If not specified, it indicates that the size is unknown.
