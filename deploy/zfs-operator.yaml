# Create the OpenEBS namespace
# This is the default namespace where the ZFS driver will create all
# its resources. If we want to change it to use a different namespace
# modify this to create the new namespace and also modify the OPENEBS_NAMESPACE
# env for the ZFS Driver's controller and agent deployments.
# please note that this should be changed while initial setup, once ZFS Driver
# is deployed with a namespace, we should never modify it as old resources will
# not be available under the new namespace and ZFS Driver looks for all the resources
# in the OPENEBS_NAMESPACE namespace passed as an env.
